## Requirements

    - Node v18
    - npm v9

## How to run the project

You need to clone or unzip the project.
In the project directory, run the following:

- `npm install`
  Install all dependencies
- `npm start`
  Runs the app in the development mode.\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Build the project

- `npm run build`
  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
   It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
   The app is ready to be deployed!

### Notes

    - There is a button above that increases the API fail response rate, it is used to show how the UI handles error/failure cases.
    - The mocked data is inside the mocks folder, you can delete or add more data with the same shape at your convenience and the functionality will not be affected.
